# Deployment Status & Solution

## Current Issue
Your Vercel deployment is getting 404 errors because the static files aren't being served correctly.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Push Updated Configuration (Recommended)
1. **In Replit**: Go to Version Control â†’ Commit and push the updated `vercel.json`
2. **In Vercel**: Your app should automatically redeploy
3. **Test**: Visit your Vercel URL again

### Option 2: Use Railway Instead (Easier)
Since you're having routing issues with Vercel, try Railway:

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Click "Deploy from GitHub"**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Add environment variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your Neon connection string
   - `NODE_ENV` = production
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = your API key
5. **Deploy**

Railway handles full-stack apps much better than Vercel.

### Option 3: Quick Fix in Vercel Settings
1. **Go to your Vercel project settings**
2. **Functions tab**
3. **Root Directory**: Set to `.` (dot)
4. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
5. **Install Command**: `npm install`
6. **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
7. **Redeploy**

## What's Happening
- Your build completes successfully
- But the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) aren't being served
- The updated `vercel.json` should fix the routing

## Expected Result
Your travel form should load at your deployment URL.

## Next Steps
Try Option 1 first (push the updated config). If that doesn't work in 10 minutes, go with Railway - it's simpler for your type of application.
