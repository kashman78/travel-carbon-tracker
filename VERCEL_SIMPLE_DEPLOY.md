# Simple Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your build is failing because the current setup is too complex for Vercel's serverless environment.

## Quick Solution

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository
1. In Replit, go to Version Control tab
2. Commit and push these new files:
   - `vercel.json` (updated configuration)
   - `VERCEL_SIMPLE_DEPLOY.md` (this file)

### Step 2: Try Vercel Again
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Delete the current failed project
3. Import your repository again with these **exact settings**:
   - **Framework Preset**: "Other"
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty or use `npm run build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Root Directory**: `.` (dot)

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` = your Neon database connection string
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = your Google Maps API key

### Step 4: Alternative - Use Railway Instead
If Vercel continues to fail, try Railway which is simpler:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select your repository
4. Add the same environment variables
5. Deploy

Railway often works better for full-stack Node.js applications.

### Step 5: Manual Deployment (Last Resort)
If both fail, you can:
1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify as a static site
3. Use Neon database for data storage
4. This gives you a working static site

## Expected Result
Your app should be live at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app` or `https://your-project-name.railway.app`

Try Railway first - it's often simpler for Node.js apps!
